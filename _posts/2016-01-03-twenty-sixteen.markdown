Happy New Year!

Didn't go for a count down this year; *TV and chill* (404 Netflix not found) at home instead.

There's a joke saying:

> Donâ€™t be too excited about this New Year stuff. <br> Only the Calendar has changed. <br> The wife and job remain the same. <br> A small reminder!

However I think it's always good to be excited on what you gonna do for a new year, even if it might not be achieveable because that's what keep you motivated!

For me, this year would continue on what I've been doing for the past year, nothing really changed but things will definitely change, in a better way, hopefully! :smile:

All the best for everyone and wish a better year ahead, world peace. :v:
