Hi I’m Shinn Chong.

> What are you?

I’m a living organism who do code for fooooood.

> Why did you decided to start writing?

For the future self. I’m delivering a message to my future self that what have changed over years and writing is one of the best ways I guess.

> What do you want to achieve ?

Think big — A better world. IMO humans are created to make this world a better world for the next generation of humans. In reality, I just want to create something for others.

> How do you deal with procrastination?

Well, sometimes I still do procrastinate… I think a good meal or view could tell me a message that “The world is so great, let’s do something and not to waste it”. Then I’ll start on moving my ass.

> So you view procrastination as a motivating factor?

It’s like “don’t go fully retard”. Don’t go fully procrastinated either.

> Do you love your life?

\#YOLO. Just love it and make it the way you like.

> What do you regret in your past 5 years?

Didn’t really play hard enough.

> What are you most proud of?

I think my ability to endure changes. The world is keep changing every day, I have to make sure that my mind is adaptive to the change, and make myself better.
